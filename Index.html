<div id="history">
<h2>Origins of BioSurf</h2>
<p>Founders and co-owners, brothers Michael and Devon Smith<br>
grew up on the south shore of Long Island New York. There they spent<br>
most of their time in the ocean, surfing big waves and having fun.<br>
However, shredding through surfboards as often as they did, the Smith<br>
brothers found that they were spending thousands of dollars on boards!<br>
After doing a little research they found out that the high cost of<br>
surfboards was due to the rare and expensive wood that is used for<br>
most boards. This means that not only were boards becoming more and<br>
more expensive, but there also wasn't a sustainable source of materials<br>
to create them. Michael and Devon decided that it was time to create<br>
a surfboard that was both affordable and sustainable, so in 2016 they<br>
founded BioSurf, the first completely sustainable surfboard company.<br>
Upon opening there was only one location in Smithtown NY, and stock<br>
was limited to roughly 30 boards of varying sizes. By 2022 the company<br>
has grown exponentially with new stores opening in Long Beach NY, Port<br>
Jefferson NY, and Montauk NY. New stock has also hit the shelves such as<br>
the BioWetsuit which is made completely out of entirely recycled material<br>
and the brand new BioWax: an organic, eco friendly surfboard wax.</p>

<h2>Why Choose Biosurf?</h2>
<h3>-Sustainable Products</h3>
<p>Every one of our products here at Bio Surf are 100% sustainable in<br>
their production and manufacturing. Our boards are made with a recycled<br>
EPS foam exterior and a hemp fiberglass core ensuring the best of both<br>
worlds for weight and maneuverability, while also giving you the peace<br>
of mind of not harming the earth.</p>
<h3>-Affordable Products</h3>
<p>Our boards are sold at rates hundreds of dollars lower than boards<br>
sold by different comanies. With prices ranging from 80-120$ it's hard<br>
for companies who are still using wood to compete. Surfboards of comparable<br>
quality to ours could go for 300$ or 400$, if made out of more expensive<br>
alternatives.</p>
<h3>-Friendly, Local Staff</h3>
<p>Our staff is comprised of some of the friendliest islanders you could<br>
come to know. With many employees being from around the area of their store,<br>
they're happy to help you with tips on local surfing spots and swells.</p>
