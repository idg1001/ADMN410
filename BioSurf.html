<p>Devon and Michael Smith grew up on the south shore of long island catching waves and rays almost everyday.
They enjoyed boogie boarding and skim boarding growing up, however the ocean sport they really fell in 
love with was surfing. When they turned 16 they each got their first very own surfboards from their 
father. However as years went on and their boards picked up some wear and tear, they were in need of
new boards. Going down to the local surf shop, the smith brothers noticed that every board besides
the plastic training ones ranged between 400$ and 700$. They were appalled! They had no idea their dad
had spent so much money on their passion. Talks with friends turned into business meetings when
they found an affordable way to produce these boards, while also being kinder to the environment.</p>
